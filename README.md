# Create a react app running python without a web server

## Overview

This repo shows how to create a react app that uses python that
runs as a static site.

The project is broken up into four steps with a `README.md`
in each folder.

You can see the final app [here](https://rob-blackbourn.github.io/demo-react-pyodide/).

## Step 1

In this [step](https://github.com/rob-blackbourn/blog-react-python/blob/master/step1/README.md) we set up a react app with material-ui.

## Step 2

In this [step](https://github.com/rob-blackbourn/blog-react-python/blob/master/step2/README.md) we get python running in the browser.

## Step 3

We [tidy up](https://github.com/rob-blackbourn/blog-react-python/blob/master/step3/README.md) step 2 to provide a pretty loading screen
and generate some matrices.

## Step 4

We [finish the app](https://github.com/rob-blackbourn/blog-react-python/blob/master/step4/README.md) and publish it to GitHub pages.
