# Create a react app running python without a web server

The project is broken up into three steps. The `README.md`
in each folder.

# Step 1

In this step we set up a react app with material-ui.

# Step 2

In this step we get python running in the browser.

# Step 3

We tidy up step 2 to provide a pretty loading screen
and generate some matrices.

# Step 4

We finish the app and publish it to GitHub pages.
